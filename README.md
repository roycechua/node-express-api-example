# node-express-api-example
This is an example of a node express api with mongoose and mongodb for a React Native mobile application's backend server.

I uploaded this example as a guide and reference but this I only copied this from the tracker-server express api from Stephen Grider's Udemy course which you can take here: [The Complete React Native + Hooks Course [2020 Edition]](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/).
